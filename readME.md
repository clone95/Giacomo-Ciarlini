# Who am I

I am a life-lover, trying to enjoy every moment and every experience, I like traveling the world and getting known of new people and cultures.

I am a data-addicted, maybe because finding meaning in data is easier than finding meaning in life. 

I am considered an excellent team player, in fact, I think that everyone can bring added value to a project and I strongly believe that every moment of exchange is a chance to learn from each other.

I consider myself _anti-fragile_: trying not just to recover after a negative situation but also to improve myself through it.

Through my international experiences and travels, I have developed an advanced knowledge of English (besides excellent Italian writing and speaking skills).

# What I Like

It's practically impossible to sum up what I like, I am voraciously curious about every aspect of life, culture and science.

I am infinitely fascinated by the possibilities of **Artificial Intelligence** and where research will take us in the coming years, and my favorite pastime is reading new research and thinking about real-world applications that can simplify and improve people's lives.

# Open Source

I am a strong supporter of OpenSource, and in particular of E-learning and its potential for democratising knowledge.

I am the founder of the **Virgilio** project, born in 2019 and grown enormously since then, thanks to the contribution of more than 50 experts, students, or just data enthusiasts from every part of the world.

Virgilio's vision is to give the possibility to everyone to get self-started in Data Science, giving useful guides and tips to orient yourself in the chaotic jungle of fragmented information of the Web, using **only free resources**.

Take a look, and contact me if you want to contribute or suggest improvements!
